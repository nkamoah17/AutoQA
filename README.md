# LLM-Powered Autonomous Agent for Mobile App Testing ( will expand to web and desktop apps later)

This project aims to create an AI-powered autonomous agent for automated Quality Assurance (QA) testing of mobile applications on Android and iOS platforms. The agent leverages Language Models (LLM) to understand test plans, generate executable test scripts, interpret the test results, and generate comprehensive test reports.

## Overview

The agent is designed to carry out the following tasks:

1. **Understand Test Plans:** The agent uses an LLM, fine-tuned on a dataset of test plans, to understand and interpret the semantics of the test plan, including setup steps, actions, and expected results.

2. **Generate Executable Test Scripts:** The LLM, once it understands the test plan, converts it into executable test scripts. This is accomplished by generating code or using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for test scripts.

3. **Run Simulations:** The generated test scripts are executed on a mobile simulator. Popular simulators like Android Emulator and iOS Simulator are utilized to mimic user interactions and simulate varying hardware configurations and network conditions.

4. **Interpret Results:** Post-test execution, the agent interprets the results to determine the success or failure of each test. This involves checking the simulator's output, reading logs, and comparing the state of the app with the expected results.

5. **Generate Test Reports:** Lastly, the agent generates a test report summarizing the results of the test run. The report provides details about each test case and a human-readable summary of the results.

## Getting Started

The first step towards building this agent involves collecting a dataset of test plans and fine-tuning the LLM on this dataset. Once the model can interpret test plans accurately, we can proceed with developing the code generation and simulation components.

## Note

This is a complex task involving multiple stages and requires significant experimentation and iterative development. However, with the right resources and a systematic approach, it is definitely achievable.
